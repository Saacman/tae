## Introduction

WSL (Windows subsytem for linux) is a compability layer that enables you to use Linux tools without the need to dual-boot. On Windows 10, a 3rd party tool is needed to use graphical applications.

## Requirements

You must be running Windows 10 version 2004 (Build 19041) or Higher. We recommend running windows updater before starting this guide.

> To check your windows version press `Windows Key + R`, type `winver` and press `Enter`.
